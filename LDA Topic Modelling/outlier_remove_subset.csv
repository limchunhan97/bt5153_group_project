you don ' have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesn ' make much sense . yet we ' re seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools . our children deserve so much better than this . even with the progress we have made , one in three children in this country is still overweight or obese . one in three is expected to develop diabetes in his or her lifetime . and this isn ' just about our children ' health ; it ' about the health of our economy as well . we already spend an estimated $ 190 billion a year treating obesity - related conditions . just think about what those numbers will look like in a decade or two if we don ' start solving this problem now . the bottom line is very simple : as parents , we always put our children ' interests first . we wake up every morning and go to bed every night worrying about their well - being and their futures . and when we make decisions about our kids ' health , we rely on doctors and experts who can give us accurate information based on sound science . our leaders in washington should do the same .","({'num_sentences': 42, 'num_words': 1001, 'num_syllables': 1268}, {'readability': 75.479, 'grade': '7th Grade'})",42.0,1001.0,1268.0,75.479,7th Grade,0.2645833333333333,en,0.053,0.846,0.1009999999999999,0.9928,1.0,1.0

you don ' have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesn ' make much sense . yet we ' re seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools . our children deserve so much better than this . even with the progress we have made , one in three children in this country is still overweight or obese . one in three is expected to develop diabetes in his or her lifetime . and this isn ' just about our children ' health ; it ' about the health of our economy as well . we already spend an estimated $ 190 billion a year treating obesity - related conditions . just think about what those numbers will look like in a decade or two if we don ' start solving this problem now . the bottom line is very simple : as parents , we always put our children ' interests first . we wake up every morning and go to bed every night worrying about their well - being and their futures . and when we make decisions about our kids ' health , we rely on doctors and experts who can give us accurate information based on sound science . our leaders in washington should do the same .","({'num_sentences': 42, 'num_words': 1001, 'num_syllables': 1268}, {'readability': 75.479, 'grade': '7th Grade'})",42.0,1001.0,1268.0,75.479,7th Grade,0.2645833333333333,en,0.053,0.846,0.1009999999999999,0.9928,1.0,1.0

track , working with a who ' who of the twin cities ' rap talent of that time . those experiences tuned his ear , molded his work ethic , and shaped his vision . in turn , those lessons have continually become more prominent in the atmosphere aesthetic , blending live musicians and sampled production with his keen sense of how to compose a well - arranged song . as for the lyrics , slug started his passion for rhyming with an obsessive - like penchant for the way words intersect , as well as how those words can be manipulated for unexpected and clever meanings . but , at the same time , early on slug expressed an interest in doing more than simply proving he could be witty , but also writing about subjects that speak to people personally , as well as emotionally . these practices also naturally helped the atmosphere fan base to expand beyond the usual independent hip hop audience , extending their reach to an alternative audience who also related to the personable appeal and emotional range of both slug ' songwriting and ant ' musical backdrops . particularly , slug has been consistently successful in leveraging his understanding for the power of words , recognizing that a song containing the right story or personal perspective can be extremely effective in capturing and holding the listener ' attention . undoubtedly , the impact of atmosphere ' music has been the roots to their long - term success , but their continued rigorous touring and performance schedule has been the vessel for engraining these stories and the legacy of the music into their fan base . early on in their careers , atmosphere stepped beyond the genre lines and performed shows through out the twin cities with rock bands , punk rock bands , and jazz ensembles . this was directly influenced by the fact that both of them were already fans of a wide range of music . although this was a natural reaction to being a fan of the music , that experience also afforded atmosphere , and their rhymesayers peers , the opportunity to witness first - hand the . i . ethos shared by some of these other musical movements . atmosphere began to apply many of these tactics and work ethics to their growth , which was specifically influential in the development of atmosphere ' approach to touring . these strategies found atmosphere expanding their tours into cities that few , if any , rap artists were including in their routing . the result is a storied connection between the artists and the listeners , which has grown into long - term atmosphere fans passing down that experience to their children and so on , and thus continually ushering in a new generation of atmosphere fans . early on in their touring excursions , atmosphere shows were noted in history for challenging the idea that hip hop audiences had to be filled exclusively with scowl - faced males fueled by ego and testosterone . instead they created an environment that invited women to join in on the party . all of these factors have led to a fan base that ranges from ages 14 - 54 and beyond , and one that remains solid , as well as ever evolving . as atmosphere steps into their 21st year of making music , slug & ant show no signs of slowing , compromising or losing sight of their vision . nor has time revealed any diminishing of those qualities that have brought them this far . as swung into gear , atmosphere had already ended the previous year and led into another with a string of singles , and still have an abundance of music on the way , including their latest album , "" fishing blues "". the title of the new album speaks directly to the sentiments that opened this bio ; is this the point in the career where atmosphere chooses to step back , put up the gone fishin ' sign and reminisce about their successes ? the answer , a resounding no , is found in the music , a collection of songs that both define and redefine the atmosphere sound . their passion and creative spark are as illuminate as ever . slug and ant still have plenty of stories to tell "" "" -

about 12 , 000 years ago , the agricultural revolution took place . mankind began farming , which gave rise to the existence of cities and larger communities . the dominance of the human species over planet earth really started here . 90 , 000 years ago , neanderthals and humans coexist in europe . fun fact : this is roughly the time period a modern spacecraft would need to reach the nearest star . homo sapiens , the modern human , evolved 200 , 000 years ago . looking at all of human history , what we call ad seems pretty small , doesn ' it ? 6 , 000 , 000 years ago , our ancestors and the modern chimpanzee shared a common ancestor for the last time , and for 2 , 750 , 000 years , stone tools were all the rage . a mere 65 , 000 , 000 years ago , the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion , which paved the way for the rise of mammals . but the dinosaurs ruled the earth for an incredibly long time : over 165 , 000 , 000 years ! that ' so long that it means a - rex that lived 65 , 000 , 000 years ago is closer to seeing a live miley cyrus concert than to seeing a live stegosaurus ! animal life on this planet started 600 , 000 , 000 years ago . the earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea creatures , then came insects , then reptiles , and finally , around 200 , 000 , 000 years ago , mammals join the party ! life itself began much further back : 3 , 600 , 000 , 000 years ago . before any animals appeared , there were 2 , 400 , 000 , 000 years when life consisted only of tiny microbes , countless single - cell bacteria . for 3 , 000 , 000 , 000 years , all life on earth was invisible to the naked eye . it ' hard to understand how single - cell organisms could develop into complex life forms like fish or sloths . the answer is time , a whole lot of time . 2 , 400 , 000 , 000 years is lot of time to work with ! 4 , 600 , 000 , 000 years ago , the sun was born from the remnants of a giant explosion , 60 , 000 , 000 years later , earth formed . in those early years , frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the earth with large oceans and a moon to send spaceships to . but as far as the whole universe goes , our solar system is pretty new . 13 , 750 , 000 , 000 years ago , the universe was born , and 600 , 000 , 000 years later , our own galaxy formed from billions of stars . but what was before the big bang ? the truth is , we don ' know that yet , and maybe we never will . but we gave it some colours so at least we have that . and there you have it : the past . now let ' take a look at what we know about the future . in roughly 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 years , the sun will be so hot that life on earth becomes impossible . the death of the sun 4 , 000 , 000 , 000 years later marks the end of the solar system . okay , so no more solar system . and what happens after that ? a few trillion years from now , star production will cease and one day the last star in the universe will die . the universe will turn dark , inhabited only by black holes . long after the last black hole has evaporated , our universe reaches its final stage , something called heat death . nothing changes anymore , the universe is dead — forever . now you ' re feeling some pretty weird feelings right now , aren ' you ? we are too . it ' only natural . the good news is , this is all far , far away . the only time that actually matters is now ! that cute girl you like , ask her out ! time is precious , make it count !","({'num_sentences': 70, 'num_words': 1262, 'num_syllables': 1410}, {'readability': 94.015, 'grade': '5th Grade'})",70.0,1262.0,1410.0,94.015,5th Grade,0.2556580050293378,en,0.059,0.86,0.081,0.9522,1.0,0.0
