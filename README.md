# BT5153 Group Project (Team 6 - Royal Flush)

Welcome to the Royal Flush GitHub repository.

In this repository, you will find four folders:
- Prediction Modelling
- LDA Topic Modelling
- Data Preprocessing
- Dataset
- Data Engineering

The relevant code files belonging to each function can be found in their respective folders.

All files are IPYNB files and can be interactively run. However, you may need to change the directory of the CSV files that are read in order to access the CSV files required. All dependencies in the scripts have also been declared.

Do note that the CSV files have been truncated in order to be uploaded onto GitHub. For the full version, please approach the owner of the repository.
