# BT5153 Group Project (Royal Flush)

Welcome to the Royal Flush GitHub repository.

In this repository, you will find four folders:
- <i>This part will be edited further later</i>
- Modelling
- Topic Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Dataset

The relevant code files belonging to each function can be found in their respective folders.

All files are IPYNB files and can be interactively run. However, you may need to change the directory of the CSV files that are read in order to access the CSV files required. All dependencies in the scripts have also been declared.
